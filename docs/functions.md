# Functions - Useful MATLAB Functions
A collection of useful functions for signal processing in MATLAB

**Functions**
  - Checking_script.m is a script for checking functions and scripts in this repository.
  - LinSpectrogram.m plots a dual column latex paper suitable spectrogram with a linear frequency axis.
  - LogSpectrogram.m plots a dual column latex paper suitable spectrogram with a logarithmic frequency axis.
  - crosscorr_t.m computes the normalised time domain cross correlation between 2 vectors
  - find_peaks.m finds the peaks in a vector with the qualifying factors proposed by Laroche and Dolson.
  - find_peaks_log.m finds the peaks in a vector with the qualifying factors proposed by Karrer, Lee and Borchers.
  - maxcrosscorrlag.m computes the lag for maximum cross-correlation between two vectors.
  - previous_peak.m finds the location of the related peak in a previous vector. Proposed by Laroche and Dolson.
  - previous_peak_heuristic.m finds the location of the related peak in the previous vector while considering the distance between the current and previous peak location. Proposed by Karrer, Lee and Borchers.
  - st_balance.m computes frame and file stereo balance of a stereo signal.
  - st_phase_coherence.m computes frame and file stereo phase coherence of a stereo signal.
  - st_width.m computes frame and file stereo width of a stereo signal.
  - ZFR.m computes speech epochs (glottal closure instants) proposed by Murt and Yegnanarayana.
