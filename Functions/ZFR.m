%   Proposed by Murt and Yegnanarayana, Epoch Extraction from Speech Signals, 2008
%   Implementation based on Rudresh et al., Epoch-Synchronous Overlap-Add
%   (ESOLA) for Time- and Pitch-Scale Modification of Speech Signals, 2018
%
%   s is the speech signal
%   N_CALC is used to switch between N values used for mean-subtraction operation
%       0: Speech 44100
%       1: Calculates fundamental frequency and adjusts accordingly
%       Otherwise: Baseline fs/220
%   fs is the sampling frequency of the signal
%   N_scale is the used to determine where N lies between 1 to 2 times the
%   average pitch period of the speaker. 1 < N_scale < 2.

%   Positive zero crossings of y indicate epochs

% For the true 2 pole ideal zero-frequency resonator, use a=[1,-2,1],
